/*

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz

WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

document.querySelect(".start")

var timer = 0;

function start() {
  start timer i++,

}

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question

var questions = [[What's JS?], [What's concat?], [What's +=?], [What does === means?]]
var answers = 

innerHTML

function answer() {
    if (answer1 || answer2 || answer3 || answer4) {
        go to function next question
    }
}

WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock



WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game = over

WHEN the game = over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
